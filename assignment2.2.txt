1)HDFS:
HDFS is a Java-based file system that provides scalable and reliable data storage, and it was designed to span large clusters of commodity servers. 
HDFS has demonstrated production scalability of up to 200 PB of storage and a single cluster of 4500 servers, supporting close to a billion files and blocks.
HDFS is a scalable, fault-tolerant, distributed storage system that works closely with a wide variety of concurrent data access applications, coordinated by YARN. 
HDFS will just work under a variety of physical and systemic circumstances. 
By distributing storage and computation across many servers, the combined storage resource can grow linearly with demand while remaining economical at every amount of storage.
